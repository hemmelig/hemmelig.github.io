    project: "AVERT—Anticipating Volcanic Eruptions in Real Time"
    description: "This project, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and in close collaboration with Alaska Volcano Observatory, will establish open-data, real-time, multi-sensor community experiments on two active volcanoes in the Aleutians, Cleveland and Okmok. A key component of the project is the development of high-bandwidth satellite telemetry that will provide real-time capabilities even in the most remote locations. Open, continuous data-streams in place before volcanic eruptions promise to revolutionize the field of volcanology by first increasing scientific understanding of eruptions and then driving the development of forecasts that are timely within the hours to months of “run-up” to eruptions, and improving forecasts as real-time data streams in."

    project: "The nBOSS—northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey—project"
    description: "The goal of the nBOSS project was to image the crust and mantle beneath northern Borneo in order to explore how the crust and upper mantle evolve after subduction termination. We operated a network of 46 seismometers between March 2018 and January 2020—the data from which are publicly available through the EarthScope Data Management Centre (previously IRIS)—and have published a number of studies in which we have applied a range of seismic imaging techniques to illuminate the sub-surface structure of this complex tectonic setting."
